# Some infos

This is an experimental project where I was testing the View-Transition API (previously called Shared Element Transitions)
When I created this project View-Transition API was an experimental API so some part of the content and documentation may be deprecated

### Before you start

- Open [chrome://flags/#view-transition](chrome://flags/#view-transition)
- Enable viewTransition API
- In your terminal launch npm i (node version at least v14.18.2)
- Then npm start

### Target

My target in this app was to reproduce something similar to iphone's photo gallery app
